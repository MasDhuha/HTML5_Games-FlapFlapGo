# Flap Flap Go
Dodge obstacles and aim for the highest score!<br/>
In this game there are 12 misterious achivements. Will you be able to find out them all?
In addition, obtain all achivements to unlock a new feature!

You can play both on PC and on Smartphone (better experience on PC). On Smartphone you need to use a browser and not a HTML viewer.

## How to play in case of server down
You'll need to change some instructions in the `.html` file:
* for <b>Style Sheet</b>: change `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://comiczen.erpnext.com/files/flapFlapGo-styleSheet.css" type="text/css"></link>`
<br/>into `<link rel="stylesheet" href="flapFlapGo-styleSheet.css" type="text/css"></link>`
* for <b>Images</b>: change every occurence of `"https://comiczen.erpnext.com/files/NAMEFILE.png"`
<br/>into `"img/NAMEFILE.png"`
* for <b>Audio</b>: change every occurence of `"https://comiczen.erpnext.com/files/NAMEFILE.mp3"`
<br/>into `"audio/NAMEFILE.mp3"`

<br/>
If you change the files position, you'll need to update the relative paths.
